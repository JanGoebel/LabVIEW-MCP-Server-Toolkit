# Simple MCP Server

## Overview

This is the most simple implementation of an MCP server in LabVIEW. It simples just one tool "Get System Stats", that returns the current CPU load and memory consumption enabling the AI to retrieve this information in a chat-conversation. This example can be used with Claude Desktop or any other MCP client.
